# chords_program

    Ok so. this is my Program of music.
    It can do alot of stuff, you can input a chord
    play it and change it scale. The program can
    also play a sequence of chords and can
    find a key from a list of chords.
    the most impresive part is it
    can hear a chord/note and predict which cord is it
    My version uses AI but i will upload a version
    without AI untill I get it better.
    for now it can guess simple chords.
    This version works for my guitar but 
    it should also work for any other instrument.
